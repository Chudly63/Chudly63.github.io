            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>My name is Alex Michael Brown. I am a Software Engineering student at Drexel University; class of 2020. I grew up in the Pocono Mountains, 
                and I have been living in Philadelphia since 2015.</p>
            <p>My interest in computers started at a very young age. In fourth grade, I attended a summer computer course where I learned to create movies 
                in old school Windows Moviemaker and how to write basic HTML and CSS. As a child, the idea of having my own website was fascinating, even if 
                it was just a file on my computer than no one else could see. I would continue to join computer programs that my school offered throughout middle school.</p>
            <p>Once I reached High School, I had the opportunity to take an Intro to Java course. My computer science teacher took my childhood interest in 
                computers and turned it into a passion. This course taught me the basics of programming using Java applets. By the end of the semester, I had 
                made my very first video game (Although it wasn't anything worth bragging about. Ever see a fighting game programmed entirely using arrays, booleans, and if statements?).
                At the turn of the semester, I immediately requested that I be transferred to the Advanced Java class.</p>
            <p>From there, the next step was to take the AP Java Exam. My AP Java class took the focus off making fun games and turned it towards learning the 
                best programming tactics. This course proved to me that I didn't just enjoy programming because I liked being able to make and play my own video 
                games; I enjoyed it for the act of programming itself. Since AP Java was the highest-level programming course my High School
                offered, I decided to pursue an independent study the following year. During this study, I began to learn C++ programming.</p> 
            <p>It wouldn't be until my Freshman year of college that I got to experience programming in teams. At Drexel, all students of the College of Computing 
                and Informatics are required to complete a Freshman Design Project. Working with a group of 5 students, we created a video game called <a href="https://thecaveoftrials.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">
                The Cave of Trials.</a> My job in the group was making sure everything was being completed on time while picking up the slack when we were in a time crunch. 
                This project was also my introduction to repositories.</p>
            <p>In recent years, I have honed my skills as a programmer through advanced classes, internships and personal projects. My favorite language to write in today 
                is Python 3. My recent classes have taught me more complex programming skills including networks and threads, while my internships and projects have allowed 
                me to discover new Python techniques. You can read about my various projects below.</p>
            <p>Outside of programming, I also participated in my local Boy Scouts of America Troop. In June of 2015, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. My Eagle Scout 
                project consisted of constructing a wedding venue outside my local District Courthouse. The completed venue had a gazebo, a small garden, a number of 
                benches, and a stone paver pathway. I had to lead a group of volunteers to get the project completed successfully. This project was a major turning point 
                in my life, as it allowed me to obtain the skills necessary to be a leader. </p>
            <p>I have several activities I like to do in my free time. One of my biggest time sinks is streaming TV shows on Netflix and Hulu. My favorite shows 
                are <b>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</b>, <b>The Office</b>, <b>Black Mirror</b>, and <b>Bojack Horseman</b>. I also enjoy listening to music such as <i>Bowling for Soup</i> 
                and <i>Dragonforce</i> or podcasts such as <i>The Adventure Zone</i> and <i>Citation Needed</i>. Tabletop gaming is another hobby of mine, and an expensive one at that. 
                There's a good reason why people often refer to Magic: The Gathering as "Cardboard Crack". Other than that, I really enjoy going out and exploring the 
                city. I often go on long walks, sometimes as long as to the Old City and back. I also use Philadelphia's IndeGo rentals to get around from time to time. 
                My favorite places to go in the city are Rittenhouse Square, The Oval, and the Schuylkill River Trail. </p>

                    <h2>The Cave of Trials</h2><br/>
                    <p>The Cave of Trials is a Windows/Mac/Android game developed using the Unity engine. The game is a 2D block pushing puzzle game where the objective is to reach the exit; often times the player is required to activate a switch before the exit will open. It contains 100% original art, music, and code. I completed this project with a team of 5 Drexel students for our Freshman Design Project. The game was completed in it's entirety within a 20 week timespan.</p>

                    <h2>NBME Web Scraper</h2><br/>
                    <p>One of the projects I completed during my CO-OP at the National Board of Medical Examiners was a Python web scraper. This Python script used the BeautifulSoup package to scrap test results from the company's Manager Training Modules. These results were organized in an Excel spreadsheet complete with conditional formatting so that the company could quickly see which employees still needed to complete their training.</p>

                    <h2>NBME CAB Pull</h2><br/>
                    <p>This project was the first that I had worked on during my CO-OP at the National Board of Medical Examiners. It is a Python script that uses ServiceNow's REST API to pull information about pending change requests. This information was organized into tabels and sent via email to all the members of the Change Advisory Board. This script was originally written by a previous CO-OP. I had to learn how the script worked and fix a major bug that prevented the script from working.</p>

                    <p>Wikipedia defines The Hitler Fallacy as: "The attempt to invalidate someone else's position on the basis that the same view was held by Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party." This Reddit bot was my attempt at demonstrating how rampent this fallacy is. This bot reads comments that are posted to Reddit's Politcs subreddit and saves all original comments that use the word "Hitler". Once a day, the bot creates a Reddit post that quotes all the comments found. The bot currently has a little over 100 subscribers.</p>

                    <h2>Animal Crossing DJ</h2><br/>
                    <p>This simple Python project plays music from the video game Animal Crossing: New Leaf. The music that plays in the game is based on the current time and weather within the game, so this script uses the current real world time and weather to play the appropriate song.</p>
